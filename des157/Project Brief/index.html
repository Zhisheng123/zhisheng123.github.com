    <h1><a href="../index.html">Project Brief</a></h1>
    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>I choose studio 2 as my final project because my focus is on web and UI UX design, so I choose project2 to improve my portfolio's interaction and visual display.</p>
    <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
    <p>I chose <a href="https://www.weflowexperience.com/">Weflow</a> as a reference because its picture interaction design is really cool. With the scroll wheel down, we want to see a story like a website introduction. Donâ€™t you want to stop at all? This is undoubtedly a success as an interaction designer. Most of his interactions are done by sliding the scroll wheel, but each photo's lack of interaction seems to be a little thin. I will design a different sense of interaction for each photo based on this study and reference point.</p>
    <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
    <p> I chose <a href="https://schweppes.ca/en/?g=false">Schweppes</a> as the second reference site. His immersive interaction is very well done. As a soda advertisement, the overall web page style feels like there are many bubbles in the liquid, which is interesting. The movement of some images causes this feeling. This is an excellent inspiration to create the feeling of being fluid through the picture's movement rules. I think the same method can make the surface of the sky or even space. I believe the shortcoming is the lack of interaction between the mouse and the picture. For example, the shaking in the water caused by touching the image with the mouse is cool. I will learn and use the movement of the image to create a sense of atmosphere.</p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal is to design a very cool and unique page for the image section of my portfolio. I will learn the sense of interaction between the above two websites using the scroll wheel. I want to tell a story that only belongs to me. The difference is that the above websites all focus on the scroll wheel's interaction and lack the interaction between the mouse. My goal is to use the scroll wheel to complete the exchange and at the same time create a different feeling for each photo so that the viewers who browse my webpage feel that every interaction is novel and exciting, and let them have a substantial effect on sliding the scroll wheel and clicking on the picture Interest.</p>
    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>My design strategy is exciting and straightforward, just like my advocating Wabi-sabi. 80% in black and white and 20% in other bright colors. The overall style is biased towards the kind of fashion website design, emphasizing pictures. I will design to use the scroll wheel to control the picture's trajectory to become larger, smaller, or move to get a sense of atmosphere, the feeling of being in the sky or the universe. Design a unique mouse click interaction for the style of each photo. I think it will be very cool.</p>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>Design the motion trajectory of the picture through the scroll wheel's sliding, such as zooming in to create an atmosphere from far to near. You can also move with the wind speed and clouds and the picture's simple range to make sense of floating. Design a different understanding of interaction according to each photograph's feeling, such as rotating zoom or transparent effect.</p>
    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal is to create an immersive atmosphere for the audience viewing my page. Use sound, picture, movement, and atmosphere to create an immersive feeling for the audience. I hope that the viewers who browse my page will feel novel and exciting for every interaction, such as scrolling the scroll wheel or mouse click to continue to look for the sense of Novel and continue browsing unconsciously.</p>
