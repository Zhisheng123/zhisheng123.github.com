            <h1>User Test Results</h1>
            <h2>Result 1: The website is too simple as a final project</h2>
            <p>Although as a previous project, I modified the photo's size by scrolling through the wheel to change the
                size of the photo within the appropriate size range. But as a final project, it is a bit too simple. To
                create more interaction, I want to create an extra layer of web pages to click to enter this layer. To
                get rid of my previous ideas, I want to set a pattern of the earth. As the years change, it will display
                the photos in different places on the earth. It can record the location of my photos and increase the
                mutual inductance.
            </p>

            <h2>Result 2: Too few pictures</h2>
            <p>I have a total of three photos to show too little content, so I plan to make two more photos, a total of
                nine pictures representing different times and different locations. One set of photos was taken in 2015
                when I was still in China, and the other set of photos was the most recent because I have moved to San
                Francisco. More photos can provide a richer sense of viewing, plus different regions and times can more
                intuitively and clearly show the information of the pictures to the audience.
            </p>



            <h2>Result 3: No footer and return key are set</h2>
            <p>Carelessness is the worst habit of designers. I forgot to set the footer-related links and the button to
                return to the homepage. I will add them in my final project. When you open a website, some pages have
                footer and other pages are not very bad, it breaks the unity of a website. When you open a website
                without a back button, it makes users feel crazy, we have all encountered that situation. I will focus
                more on my final project to do the details well.
            </p>

            <h2>Updates based on feedback:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the previous layer</li>
                <li>Expand the number of photos</li>
                <li>Add back button and footer</li>
            </ul>
