            <h1>Visual Thinking Analysis</h1>

            <figure>
                <img src="MIAMI.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Miami-Zhisheng Wang ,2020.</figcaption>

            </figure>

            <p>
                MIAMI travel is my last trip with her. This photo is a photo taken by her sitting behind me, and it is
                also the only photo of us. One beautiful morning we were strolling around on a scooter on the beach in
                Miami. This photo tells a story of our story staying in the past. The good times stay in the past, but
                the future can be expected.
            </p>


            <figure>
                <img src="ticket.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Tickets-Qinghe Zhu,2019.</figcaption>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Each ticket represents a journey, and there is a story behind each journey. I chose this photo because
                although it is only a few tickets, there are a lot of stories behind it. The time, place and each
                journey are clearly recorded in this photo, but we don't know the content behind it. So I think it is
                very interesting.
            </p>

            <h1>Menudurable</h1>

            <p>
                A good design can retain the audience. I chose <a href="https://menudurable.ca/en/">menudurable</a>
                website because its images and interaction design are
                fascinating and novel. I think a good design should be interesting, innovative, simple, and easy for the
                audience to understand; this is the second reason why I choose it. Its rich colors are suitable for
                young
                audiences, and it is essential for simple interaction and more information. Every page with a wheel
                scrolling has a different sense of interaction, which leads me to want to go down to see some new
                things.
                Unconsciously, I browse more pages and information. As a web designer, it is successful.</p>








            <h1>Reading & Response</h1>

            <p>If you reduce user learning costs, present information directly
                to the audience, let users quickly understand your product,
                and use it easily is our designers' main task today.
                Through studying this article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">
                    Best Practices for Form Design</a>I learned some techniques such as.
                Distinguish Optional
                and Required fields Minimizing the Input fields, One Column
                Layout, Ask the easy questions first. As a designer, you must
                understand these things. Building a humanized product based on
                people is the best choice when considering issues from the
                customer's perspective.</p>



            <h1>Best Practices for Modals </h1>
            <p>A good modal window
                <a href=" https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">
                    should be considered from the user's point of view.</a> It not only has
                the functions of Getting the user's attention, keeping context,
                and simplifying the UI are great benefits of modals., Similarly,
                the buttons of the web version of the modal window need to be concise and easy for users to understand.
                The modal window's position and size need to be adjusted not to cover the field of view and at the same
                time facilitate the user to browse. It also reduces the risk of interruption of user operations, such as
                using The blur effect as the background board.</p>
